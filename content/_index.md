# About Me

Hi, I'm SJ, a software engineer from South Korea.

I have worked with various programming languages and frameworks such as Spring Framework,  Django, Node.js, etc.

I have great interests in `Rust`, `Go`, and `TypeScript`.

Besides programming languages, I speak both Korean and English, so I'll be writing posts in both languages depending on the topic.

Lastly, Here are some of the links that might help represent my current status!
